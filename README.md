# Docker Overview

Docker is a containerization platform that enables applications to be packaged along with their runtime environment, libraries, and dependencies into containers. These containers run in isolation while sharing the host operating system kernel, making them lightweight, portable, and consistent across different systems.

Docker is used to solve environment consistency and deployment challenges. It ensures that applications run the same way across development, testing, and production environments, reduces dependency conflicts, speeds up deployment, and improves scalability. By standardizing application environments, Docker simplifies collaboration between development and operations teams and supports modern DevOps and microservices architectures.
